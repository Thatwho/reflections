When would you want to create a remote repository rather keeping all your work local?
when I am working in a group, all I try to share some of my work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
It's more controllable, and I would be more confident to each commit.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
forks are used in situation when I try to cooperate with others and keep the original file from GitHUb.
clone are used to cope code and information from internet to my own machine
branch are used to text new features without affect old version.
